# Elevator-Simulator

Elevator Simulator is a virtual reality game that simulate the environment of elevator during rush hour. There are always many people waiting and taking elevators wherever you are in the morning, especially in big cities like New York. If you are the one who stand beside the control panel, there must be someone asking you to press button for him/her. Undoubtedly, there are often more than one person doing that and it becomes annoying. Therefore, I create the Elevator Simulator and recreates the similar situation to make players feel annoying again!
